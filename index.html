      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>Lyft was a redesign project passed to us to develop. We started by choosing a critical path, our project scope.
         In a 10-week timespan, what would we choose to develop that would prove our skills as designers and teach us
         important technical skills? That option was the analytics route of the project. To manage and deliver data
         content to an average user, in a presentable and understandable way.</p>

      <h1>Context & Challenge</h1>
      <p>As a team we were challenged with developing a critical path from a given prototype. That critical path being
         the ride history page. We outlined tangible tasks and milestones such as an alpha and beta and sought to
         develop the Lyft prototype that we were given. In a timeline of 10 weeks we worked tirelessly to develop an
         online prototype. The purpose of the project was to give us valuable experience working in a team environment
         and to teach important technical skills. Our goal was to be able to meet deadlines while working within our
         given role as part of the team using Github and Microsoft Teams for development and communication.</p>

      <h1>Process and Insight</h1>
      <p>The team obtained designs from the previous team’s work and improved on it. Our team based on our input and
         leftover UX testing notes adjusted the designs for future development.</p>

      <p>For the design, the team decided to choose the “ride history data” as our critical path. This focused on Ride
         History allowing the user to view a monthly overview of the user’s ride data as well as a year overview.</p>

            <ul>
               <li>Font size too small</li>
               <li>Add drop down arrows to the intended dropdown</li>

               <li>Ride history card title: font size decrease</li>

                  <li>The backend influenced a UI change by combining the year and month buttons into a single button,
                     this made much more sense for our users as the original design did not come with an action button.

      <h2>Code/Dev
         <ul>
            <li>PHP was really the core of our project, it played a very heavy hand in content delivery, design
               decisions, and website structure. Our app is driven by historical records of ride history, built
               dynamically, no detail was left out here. You could add as much data as you want, and this machine will
               deliver.</li>
            <li>Google Maps</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Interactable map on the home screen to view an interactive map of the Philadelphia Center City area
                  using the Google Maps JavaScript API. Used to simulate a more realistic interface for Lyft.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Google Graphs</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Using the information from the database used the API to generate dynamic graphs that will make
                  changes based on the data for that month and year.</li>
            </ul>

      <p>With the final design we implemented what we set out to do and took into consideration any concerns about the
         design during our user testing. Some unique features that were used in creating the Lyft site were Google Maps
         and Google Graphs as they allowed the data that the user can see be dynamically driven and view in a modern and
         clean way.</p>

      <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>As a team we believe this project of redesigning the Lyft site to be a success. We learned how we can work as a
         team and the process behind that. From a technical standpoint, we learned how to communicate and use GitHub as
         a team as opposed to individual use, as well as using PHP to make the site efficient and dynamic. In hindsight,
         in terms of development, we should have planned and structured out project thinking farther forward. Some
         challenges included link changes, file re-structuring, and naming conventions. Considering those far in advance
         would have been helpful and caused fewer tedious tasks. In terms of UX testing, we could have thought smaller
         in some cases, asking very basic questions such as ‘do you want this?’ instead of assuming the answer was yes.
         Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience for the team. As we learned what each of our roles
         were within the team, we have set out to develop a critical path for the Lyft redesign to develop the online
         prototype we have today.</p>
